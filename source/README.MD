# Deep Learning Model to Predict EBV-Associated Gastric Cancer

## Introduction
This repository contains the description & source code for developing a deep learning-based model to predict EBV-associated gastric cancer. 

## Workflow
- Our deep learning model, EBVNet, aims in detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs).
